# OOP

### A Class is the JOB. 

### An Object is the person RUNNING the job

#### eg: 

#### Class = Waiter

#### Object = Henry / Betty

**ATTRIBUTES: variables attribute to our modelled Object** 

**METHODS: a particular functions that an Object can do**

```python
# Use pass to let our Class/function remain empty

# The example class below will create an error because python expects something to be written in class therefore it wants user_1 to be indented inside of User
# class User:
  
# user_1 = User()

# We can use 'pass' keyword to solve this and let our Class/function remain empty
class User:
  pass

user_1 = User()
user_1.id = "001"
user_1.username = "hazri"

print(user_1.username)
```
