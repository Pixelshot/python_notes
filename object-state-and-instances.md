# Object State and Instances

```python
timmy = Turtle()
bobby = Turtle()
```

* timmy and bobby are both instances of the Turtle object.
* That's it. That's is the definition of instance of an object.
* While both are defined under the **same** **Object**, they could have **different attributes** and could be doing **different things** 
  * For example:
  * ```python
    timmy.color = red
    bobby.color = green
    ```
* These differences can be tracked by using `state`
