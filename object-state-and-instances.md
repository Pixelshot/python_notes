```python
tim = Turtle()
jen = Turtle()
```

* tim and jen are both instances of the Turtle object.
* That's it. That's is the definition of instance of an object.
* This means that both while both are defined under the **same** **Object**, they could have **different attributes** and could be doing **different things**
